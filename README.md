Exchange Rate Prediction using Time Series Analysis
Overview
This project involves predicting exchange rates using time series analysis with Python and SQL, implementing a SARIMA model to achieve 71% accuracy in forecasts. The model is integrated with Tableau using TabPy, enabling the creation of a "What-if analysis" dashboard for senior executives to simulate how changes in external factors can influence future sales.
